# Gait-Recognition-Using-Template-Based-Methods
This repository presents an advanced approach to gait identification using three prominent template-based methods: Gait Energy Image (GEI), Gait Moment Image (GMI), and Motion Flow Energy Image (MFEI). The study leverages the CASIA-B dataset to extract gait features and enhance recognition performance.

## Methodology
Feature Extraction
The extracted gait templates were refined using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), a powerful feature descriptor known for capturing detailed edge and gradient information.

Dimensionality Reduction
To enhance computational efficiency and ensure the most discriminative features are retained, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was employed as the dimensionality reduction technique. LDA optimally separates different gait patterns, improving classification accuracy.

Classification
Three distinct classifiers were evaluated to determine the best approach for gait recognition:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Nearest Centroid (NC)
Results and Findings
The performance analysis of different gait templates and classifiers revealed that the GMI-NC combination achieved the best results. Specifically, the Nearest Centroid (NC) classifier with GMI features outperformed other methods, attaining an average accuracy of 82.82%. This combination demonstrated superior robustness across various covariate conditions, such as walking while carrying a bag, wearing a coat, and different viewing angles.
